**Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio**

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

* Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
* I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to their desired infomation.
* I included a link to a PDF of my resume (not current).
* The projects on my page are completed through KU bootcamp, empty placeholders are for future projects.
* Numbers not real for privacy concerns. 
* Everything will be kept up to date as this will be used for work.
* I will be updating the website to things ive learned in class to make things look better and show further advancement in work.
